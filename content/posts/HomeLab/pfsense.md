On this post i will cover pfSense configurations made:

- Vlan setup
- Firewall rules
- 





### ESXi setup

Since our homelab is built on top of ESXi also pfsense is stood up there.
I have allocated 1 vCPU and 1GB of Memory, that should be enough for this setup. I have run pfSense on production environment and is not resource intensive.


### Initial Configuration


### pfSense interfaces
